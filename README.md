# coalMinesUSA
Author: Ritchie Katko
The goal of this map is to compare 2 datasets thematically (coal beds and coal mines in the USA).  Data is publicly available.  
Map features:
popup functionality on all features
coal mines - point symbology scaled based on coal production, colored base on type of mine
rollover affordance with color toggling


This repo will provide a home for all html and data files that will be used for this mapping project.  

This is the final project for MAP 672.
